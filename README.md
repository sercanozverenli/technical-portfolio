# Personal R&D Hub | Technical Portfolio

This repository serves as a centralized personal research and development laboratory focusing on Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, and Software Architecture. The core objective is to document evolutionary engineering workflows, transition theoretical models into production-ready artifacts, and maintain a modular portfolio of decoupled systems.

## 🌌 Core Projects & System Architectures (Planned & Under R&D)

### 1. Amplify Core (DRDRS)
An end-to-end forecasting engine designed to extract maximum statistical signals from low-quality, heavily noisy, or temporally decayed data streams. It is planned to implement a pre-inference reliability assessment layer to minimize false confidence rates in automated decision-making pipelines.
* **Production State:** Planned / Ideation Phase 
* **Target Stack:** Python, PostgreSQL, Statsmodels, Scipy, Streamlit, Langflow, ChromaDB

### 2. Autonomous AI Orchestration
Research on multi-agent collaboration, stateful orchestration graphs, and semantic memory networks for cognitive automation and deterministic workflow routing.

### 3. Experimental Dev & Architecture Sandbox
Standalone engineering prototypes, benchmarking suites for model decay (concept drift), and high-performance pipeline configurations.

Architectural Rules
Decoupling: The Presentation Layer contains purely semantic analysis and markdown files served via Docsify. Zero production code is allowed here.

Submodule Isolation: Every directory under modules/ is an independent Git repository linked as a submodule. Updates to technical logic must be committed directly within their respective isolated micro-repos.

Data Integrity: Raw datasets are strictly bound to local environments via .gitignore policies. The repository shares execution pipelines and reproducibility scripts, not static data.

📊 Deployment & Automation
Documentation Engine: Docsify SPA running dynamically on the browser.

CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions automates deployment directly to GitHub Pages upon every push to the main branch.

GA Policy: Sub-systems under active R&D remain private inside submodules to prevent training-serving skew and regression errors. They are structurally graduated to public visibility upon meeting alpha/beta acceptance criteria.
